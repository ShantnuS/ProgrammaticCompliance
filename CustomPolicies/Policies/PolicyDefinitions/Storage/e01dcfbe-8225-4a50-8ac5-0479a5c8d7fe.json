So, all blobs in the storage account are protected with operational backup.\r\n\r\nYou can configure backup for multiple storage accounts using the Backup Center. You can also configure backup for a storage account using the storage account’s Data Protection properties.",

Also, this is a continuous backup solution, which means that you don’t need to schedule any backups and all changes will be retained and restorable from the state at a selected point in time.",
