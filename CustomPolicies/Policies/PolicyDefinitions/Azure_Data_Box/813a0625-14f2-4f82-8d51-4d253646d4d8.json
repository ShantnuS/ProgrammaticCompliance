The two roles that can be defined for the Azure Data Box service are:\r\n\r\nData Box Reader - have read-only access to an order(s) as defined by the scope. They can only view details of an order. They canâ€™t access any other details related to storage accounts or edit the order details such as address and so on.\r\n\r\nData Box Contributor - can only create an order to transfer data to a given storage account if they already have write access to a storage account. If they do not have access to a storage account, they can't even create a Data Box order to copy data to the account. This role does not define any Storage account related permissions nor grants access to storage accounts.\r\n\r\nTo restrict access to an order, you can:\r\n\r\n- Assign a role at an order level. The user only has those permissions as defined by the roles to interact with that specific Data Box order only and nothing else.\r\n- Assign a role at the resource group level, the user has access to all the Data Box orders within a resource group.",
